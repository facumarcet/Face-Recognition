# Face-Recognition
This is a Python project to test face detection features

# Features included
- Human Face detection (red rectangle)
- Smile detection (blue rectangle)
- Custom face recognition

# Test it with your own face
In order to detect your own face you need to create a new directory under "images" and name it wherever text you want to display when your face is detected.
Once you created that you will need to populate the new directory with pictures of your self in png/jpg format.
The next step is to run face-train.py file:
```powershell
python .\faces-train.py
```
Then run main.py and test it out.
```powershell
python .\main.py
```
